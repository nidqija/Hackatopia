Experts, including psychologists, legal advisors, and survivors, can share their insights, offering solutions and guidance. Social media campaigns can amplify awareness through engaging posts, infographics, and interactive content like quizzes and live Q&A sessions. A month-long themed campaign can highlight various aspects of violence and ways to combat it. Art-based initiatives, such as exhibitions, short film contests, poetry slams, and street art projects, provide creative platforms for expression, helping to spread impactful messages while giving survivors a voice." , image : "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1271352080/photo/how-to-stop-violence.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=YFlEyC4haOMLpvAnrh4PPUI5pO0tf3QsFO2zZYf3-jc="},

Free self-defense training, led by security professionals, can equip individuals—especially women, children, and vulnerable communities—with essential safety skills. Establishing safe spaces in community centers, cafes, and religious institutions can offer refuge for victims in need of immediate assistance. Support groups, counseling services, and peer mentorship programs can create a network of care, ensuring survivors receive emotional and psychological help. Additionally, raising awareness about emergency hotlines through posters, social media, and local partnerships ensures that victims know where to seek help in times of crisis." , image : "https://res.cloudinary.com/delib/images/w_1400,c_limit/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1718124905/newsroom/community-engagement-1/community-engagement-1.jpg?_i=AA"},
    {id : 3 , title : "Policy & Advocacy" , description : "Advocacy efforts can drive legal and systemic changes to better protect individuals from violence. Online and offline petitions can be launched to demand stronger laws and policies, while peaceful protests, candlelight vigils, and public forums can raise awareness and push authorities to take action. Collaborating with law enforcement and NGOs can improve victim protection services, legal aid, and shelter support. Encouraging a 'speak-up' culture through anonymous reporting tools in workplaces, schools, and public spaces can empower victims and bystanders to report violence without fear of retaliation. These combined efforts aim to create safer environments through policy reform and community engagement." , image : "https://aunetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Advocacy-Groups-for-Public-Policy-Research.jpg"},
